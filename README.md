## **Overview**

Data source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/devarajv88/delhivery-logistics-dataset    
This dataset is about Delhivery's logistics operations in India.  

This Jupyter notebook provides a comprehensive analysis of logistics data with two main objectives:

1. **Data Visualization and Analysis**: The notebook includes various visualizations and analysis that help in understanding patterns and trends in logistics data.
2. **Machine Learning Model**: The notebook builds predictive models using machine learning to predict transportation time based on the given dataset.


## **Contents**

1.**Introduction**: Introducing logistics data in the dataset.   
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming the dataset, including handling missing data, skewed data and encoding variables.  
3. **Data Visualization**: Generating insightful visualizations, such as bar plots, scatter plots, and boxplots, to explore relationships in the data and present business insight.   
4. **Feature Engineering**: Extracting and process features for prediction models.  
5. **Model Training**: Training machine learning models to predict transportation time based on the features in the dataset.  
6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the performance of models using appropriate metrics to measure its prediction accuracy.  

**Models**:  Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, KNN, SVR and MLP Regressor models.  
**Evaluation Metrics**: mean squared error, mean absolute error, median absolute error and R-squared.
